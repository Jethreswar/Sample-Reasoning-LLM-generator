# Sample-Reasoning-LLM-generator

**Reasoning LLMs using Hugging Face Model**

## Overview
This project explores the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using the Hugging Face **Flan-T5 XL** model. The implementation provides a structured framework for generating responses to reasoning-based tasks such as logical analysis, problem-solving, and chain-of-thought reasoning. It leverages Hugging Face's `transformers` library for model loading and inference.

## Features
- **Prompt-Based Reasoning**: Generates structured responses based on carefully crafted prompts.
- **LLM Interaction**: Utilizes `Flan-T5 XL` to process input queries and provide detailed answers.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Uses the `transformers` library for seamless model loading and inference.
- **Customizable Inference**: Users can tweak parameters such as temperature, max token length, and sampling strategies for response generation.

## Installation
To set up the environment and run the project, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

Ensure that you have a GPU-enabled machine with CUDA installed for optimal performance.

## Usage
The project provides various functions to generate responses based on reasoning tasks. Here is a basic usage example:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
import torch

# Load the model and tokenizer
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model_name = "google/flan-t5-xl"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name).to(device)

# Function to generate a response
def generate_response(prompt, max_length=512):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
    outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=max_length, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7)
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Example query
prompt = "Solve this math problem step-by-step: If a train covers 120 miles in 3 hours, what is the speed?"
print(generate_response(prompt))
```

## Applications
- **Logical Reasoning**: Providing explanations based on logical rules and given facts.
- **Mathematical Problem Solving**: Step-by-step breakdown of complex problems.
- **Blocksworld Planning**: Generating structured action sequences for AI planning problems.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the model to support multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning.
- Experiment with fine-tuning the model on domain-specific reasoning tasks.
- Implement an interactive web-based interface for easier user interaction.
